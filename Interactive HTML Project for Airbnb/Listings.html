            <h2><br><br><br>The Impact Of The Pandemic Towards Airbnb Occupancy Rate</h2>
            <p>
              In this site there are four interactive line charts that shows the impact of the pandemic in different regions. As the virus was first identified in Wuhan, China, it is depicted that the occupancy rate of Airbnb rooms in Beijing and Shanghai have an earlier decline in occupied rooms compared to other regions. China has imposed a ban for both the interstate and international travels back in January 23th as an effort to contain the virus, hence it is expected to notice a sharp decline in occupied rooms for all regions in Asia Pacific due to the travel restrictions.

            This graph shows the number of occupied rooms based on their dates in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. It also states that both Beijing and Shanghai has a number of occupied rooms that are always above average up until January 23th. Click around to see what happen!

          The graph indicates the number of occupied rooms based on their dates in the regions that are situated in Australia. In 19th of March, the Australian government implemented a travel ban for any international arrivals in Australia. This is followed by an interstate border restriction in 24th March in South Australia, and then in early April for Melbourne and Sydney. Although Melbourne's and Sydney's room occupancy rate are still above average throughout the year, on average, there is a gradual decline in the number of occupied rooms since the travel ban is applied. Even after the Wuhan lockdown back in China has been lifted in 8th of April, the number of occupied rooms were still remarkably low until June 2020. Move your cursors around to see what happen!

          This line chart presentes the number of occupied rooms based on their dates in the other regions, which are Taiwan, Singapore and Japan in Asia Pacific. Based on the graph above,the occcupancy rate of Airbnb rooms has been reduced by more than half for these regions. One example to look into would be the occupancy rate in Tokyo, which has 808 rooms back in 1st December 2019, but has suffered a gradual decline down to only 99 in 1st June 2020. These graph has a slower decline compared to regions in Australia and those that are near to the city of Wuhan, which is due to the lower number of available Airbnb rooms, strict response to the pandemic outbreak in places such as Singapore or existing social norms of wearing face masks in public in Tokyo.

            The graph represents the number of occupied rooms for all the regions based on their dates.As you looking closely into the graph, you can see a slightly constant trend of shapes similar to spikes for all regions. This is due to the increase in Airbnb customers in the weekends, as a majority of them prefer to stay in Airbnb rooms in Saturdays and Sundays, when they are not constrainted by work and urged for a quick break. For example: the number of rooms occupied in 16th November 2019, which is a Saturday, tend to have the most occupied rooms compared to the rest of the week between 10th and 17th.
